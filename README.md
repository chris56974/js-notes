# JS Notes

These are my personal JS notes that I made to understand stuff better. The majority of which is written in my own words using my own examples. I didn't think I would share this repo publically, so I may not have attributed other people's work properly in some instances, but I've made an effort to include as many attributions as possible down below. This repo is for educational purposes.
