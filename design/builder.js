/** 
 * It's popular in languages like Java where you have a bunch of parameters
 * (more than 4) that can be optional. It's when you create an object by
 * chaining different functions together. Unlike a factory which decides 
 * what object to generate based on hidden criteria, the builder is something you're very explicit with.
