/** 
 * It's a behavioural design pattern that uses a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. 
 * Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle. 
 * The rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain. 
 * A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of the chain.
