/** 
 * Is a structural pattern where you use a flyweight, 
 * which is an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects. 
 * It's a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use 
 * an unacceptable amount of memory. Often, some parts of the object state can be shared, and 
 * it is common practice to hold them in external data structures and pass them to the objects temporarily when they are used.
