/** 
 * It's a behavioural pattern based around "null objects". 
 * A null object is an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral "null" behaviour.
 * Instead of using a null reference to convey absence of an object, 
 * you instead use an object that implements the interface but has an empty method body. 
 * The advantage is that it does nothing and it's very predictable.
