/** 
 * A HOF is a function that accepts and/or returns another function. 
 * They're great at creating reusable functions. 
 * All ES6 methods are HOFs because they all take in a callback. 
 * It's "higher" as in, it doesn't operate on the first order stuff like primitives. 
 * A function that isn't HOF is FOF "First Order Functions".
